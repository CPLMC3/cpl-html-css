         Sharks, one of the most feared animals to the human race. Many misconseptions about sharks coast the lives of up to 11 million sharks or more,for every human that is attacked. Although sharkes are relitivly gental giants when undisturbed in their natural habittats. But on the rare occation when they do attack they usualy mistak people swimming or on surfboards as seals the sharkes main food source. Or you get to close for the sharks comfort zone. As shown by map below tracking sharks, shark attacks are uncomon.

       Out side of shark attacks we know little about shark behavior, other than the fact that sharks often try to gain the upper hand around people. However philmers have found that as long as you cans see the shark you have the upper hand. To sharks we are just as mistierious to them as they are to us. </p>
