         One of the most feared animals to the human race. Many misconseptions about sharks coast the lives of up to 10 billion sharks or more,for every human that is attacked. Although sharkes are relitivly gental giants when undisturbed in their natural habittats. But on the rare occation when they do attack they usualy mistak people swimming or on surfboards as seels the sharkes main food source. Or you get to close for the sharks comfort zone. As shown by map below tracking sharks, shark attacks are not and quiet rare.
